# jigsaw_toxicity_classification
Kaggle competition : Detect toxicity across a diverse range of conversations

In this competition, you're challenged to build a model that recognizes toxicity and minimizes this type of unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities. You'll be using a dataset labeled for identity mentions and optimizing a metric designed to measure unintended bias. Develop strategies to reduce unintended bias in machine learning models, and you'll help the Conversation AI team, and the entire industry, build models that work well for a wide range of conversations.
